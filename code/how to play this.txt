WHAT IS THIS?
Vj-dada is a real time sound and video performance based on the analysis of the frames of the film Rhytmus 21 by
Hans Richter.
It consists of two parts:
- Video Analysis and player application (windows 32 C++ app under OpenFrameWorks v0.06)
- Audio Synthesis application (Pure data extended v0.41.4)

Video is played by the executable found in /binVideo/
Audio is played by the Pd patch found in /audioPd


SET UP:
- Get a computer with a Windows XP (or compatible windows 32) and be sure that the background color of the desktop 
is a solid black (for having a black canvas at the end).
- Install Pd-extended 0.41.4 found in /Pd-extended_Installer
- Open Pd and configure your audio settings for a 5.1 format (ch1 L, ch2 R, ch3 LR, ch4 RR, ch5 F, ch6 Sw) that
matches your audio system. Be sure of computing audio in Pd.
- Run the executable /binVideo/vjDada.exe, it automaticaly opens a window of 2048x768, so you will need two monitors
configured in extended desktop mode for visualizing the video. Video runs on the rightest part of the window. On the
left side, you can see a control and monitoring window. For activating the verbose mode (yo will be able to read
and see the analysis) press "v". Press again "v" for deactivating it.  
- Remove the decoration of the window if it appears in your system. For that you can just adjust the monitor 
(a vertical shift) for removing its frame or, better, use a Window manager for configuring the permanent properties
or appearance of the windows of your applications.  

PLAYING IT:
- Video and Audio app are communicated by OSC. Audio app waits for parameters from video´s and plays them. 
- By default, after opening both apps you won´t see or listen anything. 
- For starting the performance, this is the behaviour (version November 2010):
+ Press "1" for starting playing the original video with audio
+ Press "2" when the original video has finished (you will see "fin" frames) for starting part number 2 (Variations)
+ Press "3" when the previous part has finished for starting part number 3 (silence with noise)
+ Press "4" when the previous part has finished for starting part number 4 (alea frames) and start pressing key "z"
until you see the credits of the film. This part is ad libitum and its duration is not determinated. 
+ Press "7" for the end of the performance by closing the video app.

 
COMPILING ITS SOURCE CODE:
- In folder /src you can find the source code of the C++ app that can be compiled against an OpenFrameWorks v0.06 so
it can run in any plattform (Win, Mac, Linux...). 
- Its library dependencies are only v0.06´s  
- Original source code was edited under Code Blocks 8.02 so I include the workspace files also.
